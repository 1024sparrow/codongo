gui - Qt/QML application that displays overlay keyboard

logics - mouse events reader. this util must be started under root. This reads touch-screen events, then generates corresponding events to virtual keyboard and write corresponding commands in ~/.codongo-kb.fifo for gui and to codongo input device (to map on codongo virtual keyboard and codongo virtual mouse).

codongo_km - kernel module (loadable): Virtual mouse (touchpad) device, virtual keyboard device and codongo input device (all on one kernel module). Codongo writes events there.
